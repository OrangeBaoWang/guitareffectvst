Note for Zynewave Podium(and possibly other DAWs):

you need to put all the other dlls(libfftw3-3.dll, libfftw3f-3.dll, libfftw3l-3.dll, libsamplerate-0.dll, libsndfile-1.dll, DevIL.dll, ILU.dll)
in where the Podium.exe(REAPER.exe, Cubase.exe, etc) is. System32 doesn't work.
To make this more convenient, I need to make a bridge dll for that but it's a lot of work so until then..



Currently, all the codes are converted and usable in VST code but no GUI interface whatsoever.(not even parameters are mapped)
I have implemented processReplacing in each effect so it can be used in VSTPlugin::processReplacing.

But, I have not converted Looper and Vocoder for apparent reasons.

Code is for Visual C++ 2010(Express). Project file is placed under VSTGL directory.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code guideline:

- it usually retains original code
- it adds processReplacing() for every out().
- you need to reset PERIOD and fPERIOD for every processReplacing call in the processReplacing func.
- thus functions that uses PERIOD or fPERIOD needs to be updated too.
- for EffectLFO you need to call update() in processReplacing() like this:
void APhaser::processReplacing()
{
    ...

	PERIOD = sampleFrames;
	fPERIOD = PERIOD;
	invperiod = 1.0f/fPERIOD;
	lfo.update();
    (from APhaser.cpp) 

    ...
}
